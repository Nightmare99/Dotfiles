# Global Rules
## Coding Standards
### Python
- Follow the Zen of Python.
- Use the uv package manager for python packages.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use the npm package manager for javascript packages.

### React
- Always stick to functional components.
- For new projects, use Zustand for state management. For old projects, use existing state management, if any, unless specified otherwise by the user.

## Workflow
- Do not try to automatically start any server - recommend the user to do so.
- If you fail to fix an issue/bug after 2 attempts of fixes, add console logs and ask the user to run the code to see the error and paste it to you.
